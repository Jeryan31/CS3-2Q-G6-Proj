        <h2>THE MATATAG CURRICULUM</h2>
        <p>This curriculum aims to revise the current Kindergarten to Grade 10 curriculum to ensure that students develop basic literacy and numeracy skills, offering them the right balance of academic and extracurricular activities.</p>
		
	<h3>SPECIAL EDUCATION RESOURCES</h3>
	<p>Students with disabilities might not get enough support and services, causing them to fall behind their classmates in their education. Due to this, a curriculum for students with special needs has been implemented, such as strategies and tools for better access to learning.</p> 
		
	<h4>ACCESS TO QUALITY TEACHERS</h4>
	<p>There is often a shortage of qualified teachers in underprivileged schools, leading to the impact of the quality of education students receive.</p>
		
	<h5>RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES</h5>
	<p>Minority students often encounter obstacles in their education, such as unfair treatment, lower expectations from teachers, and fewer chances to take challenging classesâ€”causing the students to receive poor education quality.</p>
